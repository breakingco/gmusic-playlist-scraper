# gmusic-playlist-scraper
Proof of concept to demonstrate usage of the gmusic API to help digitise your own music collection or recover after catastrophic local loss.

Accesses a specified playlist on your Google Music account and bulk searches for torrents for the albums contained within it, so that you may quickly bulk download those purchased albums from it instead of needing to download each track separately via the gmusic interface.
